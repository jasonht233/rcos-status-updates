There is a folder called mystudy 
which record what I have learned and what I have practiced 
during this semester. 
It is most about the php but for the new learner and not so
familiar with RCOS and our project- I've learned along time 
for the front about html and css
Meanwhile what we set up for php is a huge problem I takes a long time to set up a good environment for my php study 
However I really enjoy using php and doing something about the website.
