Last weak, I have enhanced the knowledge of the PHP skills and doing whatever and I am learning somehting about the PHP and something about 
java script and something about the csc. Which is also every important to learn in the hw 

This weak we are going to find out the server and go to find out how to connect to the server and try to finish some back-end operations 
and enhanced our skills in the back end 

However, I have really a hard time to figure out the how to set up the environment for php.
There are so many probles for me to set up the environment.

Meanwhile, I'm still learning the html and css and javascript stuff which takes me a long time to get used to the weird stuff
