For the end of the week.

Because I don't have too much stuff in my commit. I feel sorry for my team
Even Though Our team almost doesn't require the back-end skills most of the front-end
However, we still can use this knowledge for our later development. 

So I start to collect what I have learned and record it into a new fold to record 
everything in that.
