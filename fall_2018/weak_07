These week we still have problem to use the 3-D camera to take some pictures, but we only need an Android phone to connect with the camera. 


Meanwhile we are doing soemhing in the backend. How to send the pictures from the back end to the front end. And we want something like the 
google street-view, we can move and catch the view in the website. However it is pretty difficult and hard to implement. So we will get some knowledge
in the graph.
