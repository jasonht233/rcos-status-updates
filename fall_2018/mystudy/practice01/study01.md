How to set up the environment for the PHP and SQL:

Because we donâ€™t have a connections, so we must use our own pc as the host for our back-end studying. I choose Xampp for mySQL(Free Trail) and Apache and Navicat for our database management. (Because I learn the php language and the basic rules for html and the css, javascript, Later in the semester, I would use the php)

However you have to change something in the Xampp to enable the this, like change the port in the Apache port so that we can finish that
